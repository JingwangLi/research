== About
I am currently a PhD student at [https://hkust.edu.hk the Hong Kong University of Science \& Technology], under the supervision of [https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SpVboHsAAAAJ Prof. Vincent Lau]. My research interests primarily revolve around decentralized optimization, specifically the design and analysis of efficient decentralized algorithms. Previously, I earned a BMgt in Engineering Management from [https://en.hzau.edu.cn Huazhong Agricultural University], and an MEng in Control Science & Engineering from [https://english.hust.edu.cn/ Huazhong University of Science & Technology]. For further details, please refer to my [/cv.html CV].

== News
- May 2025: Our paper, "Dual Acceleration for Minimax Optimization: Linear Convergence Under Relaxed Assumptions", is now available on [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.02115.pdf arXiv].
- May 2025: Our paper, "Smoothness of the Augmented Lagrangian Dual in Convex Optimization", is now available on [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.01824.pdf arXiv].
- Aug. 2024: I start my PhD at HKUST.
