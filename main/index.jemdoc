== About
I am an incoming PhD student at [https://hkust.edu.hk the Hong Kong University of Science \& Technology], advised by [https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=SpVboHsAAAAJ Prof. Vincent Lau].\n\n

Previously, I received a BMgmt in Engineering Management from [https://en.hzau.edu.cn Huazhong Agricultural University] and an MEng in Control Science & Engineering under the supervision of [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Housheng-Su Prof. Housheng Su] from [https://english.hust.edu.cn/ Huazhong University of Science & Technology]. After earning my MEng, I worked as an algorithm engineer at [https://www.fabu.ai FABU.AI], engaging in modeling and solving optimization problems related to autonomous driving. Upon deciding to pursue a PhD, I resigned and went to [https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen] as a research assistant, where I worked on accelerated decentralized optimization under the mentorship of [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WkRojboAAAAJ&hl=en Prof. Xiao Li]. 

== News
- Dec. 2023: Our work "NPGA: A unified algorithmic framework for decentralized constraint-coupled optimization" has been accepted by /IEEE Transactions on Control of Network Systems/.
- Sept. 2023: I have been an RA at CUHKSZ.
- Sept. 2023: I resigned from FABU.AI.

== Research Interests
My research interests primarily revolve around the theory and applications of decentralized optimization. Currently, I am particularly interested in developing communication and computation efficient algorithms to solve a class of decentralized optimization problems with globally coupled constraints. In this context, we usually consider a networked system consisting of $n$ agents, and the underlying network topology can be represented by an undirected or directed graph. The problem of interest can be formulated as follows:
\(
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \min_{x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}, y \in \mathbb{R}^p} \  & \sum_{i=1}^n \left(f_i(x_i) + g_i(x_i)\right) + h(y)   \\
    \text{s.t.} \               & \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_ix_i = y,
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation} \label{original_pro}
\)
where $f_i:\mathbb{R}^{d_i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $g_i:\mathbb{R}^{d_i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}$ and $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{p \times d_i}$ are private for agent $i$, while $h:\mathbb{R}^p \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \cup \{+\infty\}$ is public for all agents. The problem $\eqref{original_pro}$ captures a wide range of real-world scientific and engineering problems, including decentralized vertical federated learning, decentralized optimal transport, decentralized resource allocation, and more, which is exactly why it appeals to me so much.
