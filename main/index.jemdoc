== About
Since Sept. 2023, I have been working as an Research Assistant in [https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)], where my research focuses on non-smooth decentralized optimization under the supervision of [https://www.xiao-li.org/ Dr. Xiao Li]. From Jun. 2022 to Sept. 2023, I worked as an R&D Engineer at [http://www.fabu.ai FABU.AI], focusing on addressing optimization problems in the field of autonomous driving. Prior to that, I pursued my master's degree at [http://english.hust.edu.cn/ Huazhong University of Science & Technology], where I conducted research on the theory of decentralized optimization under the supervision of [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Housheng-Su Prof. Housheng Su]. Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [https://www.hzau.edu.cn/en/HOME.htm Huazhong Agricultural University].
