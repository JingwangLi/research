== About
I am an algorithm engineer in [http://www.fabu.ai fabu.ai] since June 2022. Before that, I was a master student in the School of Artifical Intelligence & Automation of Huazhong University of Science & Technology, where I worked on distributed/decentralized optimization under the supervision of [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Housheng-Su Housheng Su]. Prior to that, I graduated from Huazhong Agricultural University and got a bachelor degree in management, where I transfered from the School of Fisheries to the School of Public Administration in the sophomore year.
