== About
Since Jun. 2022, I has been an R&D engineer in [http://www.fabu.ai FABU.AI], where I focus on addressing various optimization problems emerging in autonomous driving. Before that, I was a master student in the School of Artifical Intelligence & Automation of Huazhong University of Science & Technology, where I worked on decentralized optimization under the supervision of [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Housheng-Su Prof. Housheng Su]. Prior to that, I graduated from Huazhong Agricultural University and got a bachelor degree in engineering management.
